# MothersDayAdventureGame
 A Mother's Day Adventure Game to practice OOP.
 
This Mother's Day game uses a state pattern to control each scene of the game.

This program could not have been created without Michael haldye and his Intro to C# series on Youtube.
I learned how to create an adventure game using this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBadZxYe6I4&list=PL-LDQE9x9hLwldZPPGwqXixr-_DfINfxk&index=31_

I recreated this project from memory for learning purposes. I hope you enjoy, I know I did!
